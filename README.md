This is my first portfolio project. This project is intended to be a loose imitation of the system that FedEx admins use in their day to day operations. My Wife is an admin at our local FedEx, and I am a driver, so i have a bit of experience on the logistical side of things. 
This project is a work in progress and is being used to cut my teeth on several technologies including Entity Framework, MySql, and Avalonia UI. I will continue to add documentation, and updates on my plans for how to proceed.
