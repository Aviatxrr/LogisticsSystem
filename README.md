This is my first portfolio project. This project is intended to be a loose imitation of the system that FedEx admins use in their day to day operations. My Wife is an admin at our local FedEx, and I am a driver, so i have a bit of experience on the logistical side of things. 
This project is a work in progress and is being used to cut my teeth on several technologies including Entity Framework, MySql, and Avalonia UI. I will continue to add documentation, and updates on my plans for how to proceed.

If you would like to install and play with this, you will need to do a few things:

1: Create a database using the databaseschema.txt, this file needs updated as some things have been added since via dbeaver and the original schema is incomplete; dont worry its on the todo list

2: use the database test seeder to fill to generate fake entities to use. This system also needs updates amd documentation.

3: create a user to log in to the system. The Users table is one table i have locally on my machine that is not updated in the schema.

4: run the Avalonia app, and you should be good to mess around with it.

Once i approach a more finished state, i will add some scripts to automatically create test data and a single user for people to test the system out.

Thanks for checking out my project! Ive learned lots of new stuff and I'm excited to finally be dipping my toes in putting projects on the internet attached to my name. If you want to get in touch for any reason, my Twitter is linked in my Github profile! :)
